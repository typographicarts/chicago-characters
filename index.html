								<h3>Alicia M&aacute;rquez</h3>
								
								<p>Alicia M&aacute;rquez is a letter artist who loves to use calligraphy and letter carving to express herself.</p>
								<p>After graduating with a degree in graphic design from the University of Buenos Aires, she worked as an art director in advertising agencies and in-house design departments in Buenos Aires, Miami, and Chicago.</p>
								<p>She has practiced calligraphy and letter carving for 10 years and recently started to explore an abstract approach using traditional techniques. She defines herself as an eternal student and intense observer, continually learning and perfecting her craft.</p>
								<p>As an artist, Alicia thinks the journey is more important than the outcome itself, and she encourages an open interpretation and constructive criticism. As a designer, she is always looking for the clear, simple, minimalistic way to communicate. The artist and the designer in her meet every day, in every project, and usually (but not always) they get along well.</p>

								<h3>Dana Arnett</h3>
								
								<p>Dana Arnett grew up in a Midwestern town that, like his own identity, was defined as much by its modesty as its wide open expanses. As a child, he loved to draw and paint, and he vividly remembers the first time he saw "commercial art," in the pages of Communication Arts at a local art-supply store. He soon became enthralled with the work of Paul Rand, Bart Forbes, Saul Bass and legendary ad man Helmut Krone.</p>
								<p>After high school, Arnett headed to Northern Illinois University to study visual communications. In his sophomore year, he was asked to leave the program after the faculty rejected his portfolio, taking issue with his contrarian view and love for experimentation. A week later, a group of esteemed designers from Chicago awarded his work best of show in the university's student design competition. By then, Arnett had already declared a new interdisciplinary major, "comprehensive design." In retrospect, he admits this was a blessing in disguise: The more expansive degree allowed him to take risks and develop a broader approach to design, something that would pay off years later.</p>
								<p>At a campus lecture the following year, Arnett had his first fortuitous encounter with visionary design entrepreneur and strategist Robert (Bob) Vogele. It was the beginning of what Arnett has described as "a three- or four-year conversation that Bob was open to having whenever I was in Chicago." Through these encounters, Vogele recognized untapped passion and leadership qualities in the young Arnett, so when he conceived the idea of a next-generation design agency during the early 1980s, he brought Arnett in to help create and lead the now-venerable VSA Partners.</p>
								<p>Arnett is a member of the Alliance Graphique Internationale and a former adjunct professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He has served on the boards of both AIGA (2001–2004) and the Society of Typographic Arts, and he is currently on the board of the Architecture and Design Society at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>

								<h3>Sonnenzimmer</h3>
								
								<p>Sonnenzimmer is the collective work of artists Nick Butcher and Nadine Nakanishi. Their collaborative practice was established in 2006. Initially recognized for their idiosyncratic commissioned screen-printed posters, their practice has since morphed into an interdisciplinary toolshed spanning multiple platforms, including exhibitions, publishing, performance, graphic design, and exhibition design. Equal parts balancing act between art and design and radical reclamation of all aspects of visual expression, the studio is grounded in the lasting potential of the graphic arts, while exploring the physical and conceptual friction between abstraction and communication.</p>

								<h3>Vernon Guider</h3>
								
								<p>Born on the south side of Memphis, Guider says it was the small blackboards in school that taught him control in lettering. "There were about 10 inches of space all around the blackboard," he explains. "I learned the alphabet on the blackboard."</p>

								<p>His mother, Nannie Lomax, was a seamstress. His father, Will Guider, was a brick mason. The family came to Chicago in 1937 and settled in Washington Park, where the teenage Vernon found odd jobs. While working on a foundation dig, he was asked by another laborer to help paint a three-room house near 45th Place and Vincennes.</p>

								<p>In 1945 Guider went into business with LeRoy Winbush, another Memphis native. Their studio was across the street from Phillips, on the third floor of a building at 47th and Parkway that adjoined the Regal Theatre. "When I was with him, we never had one argument," says Winbush. "We've been friends for 56 years."</p>

								<p>Guider was befriended by his landlord, Harry Englestein, who owned the building that housed the Regal, the Savoy, and the South Center Department Store on 47th Street. He helped Guider get a contract with the Regal. Soon Guider's signs were promoting Cab Calloway, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, and Jay McShann. He also did promotional movie signs for the Regal.</p>

								<p>Perhaps his largest still-standing creation is the sign that covers the side of Queen of the Sea, the 45-year-old soul food institution on 47th Street. His understated wit hooked Mary Anderson, the now deceased original owner, who didn't even know what she wanted to call her restaurant when she hired Guider to make the sign. "'Mary's' didn't say anything," he says. "'Anderson's' didn't say anything. I asked, 'You're going to specialize in seafood? Why don't you call it 'Queen of the Sea?' She loved it."</p>

								<h3>Leroy Winbush</h3>
								
								<p>It took LeRoy Winbush 11 years to become the first black member of the Art Directors Club of Chicago, but once the organization accepted him, only five years to become its president.</p>
								<p>Winbush moved to Chicago from Detroit as a teenager and became a graphic designer there in 1936, one week after he graduated from high school. At the time, the profession had only a few black practitioners. Winbush jumped from an apprenticeship in a sign shop to a job designing signage, murals and flyers for the Regal Theater, where he "rubbed shoulders" with performers such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington.</p>
								<p>A 1958 Ebony article profiling Winbush—entitled "The Barnum of Bankers Row"—indicates how successful his business model was. Winbush "excelled at exhibit design," according to Victor Margolin, and he convinced a bank in the heart of Chicago's financial district to hire him to create window displays. Such things were unheard of in banking at the time, but Winbush Associates soon cornered the market its principal had invented, devising elaborate narrative displays with mannequins and props for 62 clients in the financial industry.</p>
								<p>In 1959, he served as chairman of exhibits for the International Design Conference at Aspen, which he was closely involved with for eight years. Winbush also helped design Illinois's exhibit at the 1964 New York World's Fair—including its animatronic Abraham Lincoln, which was the prototype for the figures in the Hall of Presidents at Disney World.</p>
								<p>A few years later, Winbush began teaching visual communications at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) and typography at Columbia College Chicago.</p>
								<p>Although Winbush insisted that he wanted to be known as a "good designer," not a "black designer," he "believed he could use design as a tool to help the black community," says AIGA national board member Vernon Lockhart, who considered Winbush his mentor. He developed a long-term exhibition about sickle-cell anemia for the city's Museum of Science and Industry and in 1990 became an exhibition consultant to the DuSable Museum of African-American History. Winbush continued designing exhibitions for the DuSable on subjects such as the Underground Railroad and the uprising on the slave ship Amistad until he was well into his 80s.</p>
								<p>In an interview with DeBose, Winbush acknowledged that he might not have been the only black designer fighting for unequivocal acceptance, "but I didn't know of too many others. Every place I went I was by myself." He told DeBose that he joined the ADC and the Society of Typographic Arts largely to "open the door" for other black designers.</p>

								<h3>Trends</h3>
								
								<p>The hashtag, or octothorpe, has been a major part of our extended alphabet since social media platforms adopted its use for searching just 11 years ago. 
Whether called hash, pound, number sign, lumberyard — the symbol traces back to Ancient Rome. Its story starts with the Latin term Libra Pondo, meaning "pound in weight." This was abbreviated to lb, which we still use. When lb became standard, it was often drawn with a little bar across the tops of both letters (℔), just to show that the l and the b were connected. As scribes started writing this sign faster and faster, lbbegan to morph.</p>
								<p>Over time, the symbol's meaning started to bifurcate — it was used for the unit pound, and it also started to be used as a number sign. It was important enough to wind up on typewriter keyboards, which helped it survive.
Fast forward to 1963. the invention of the touch tone telephone. Unlike rotary phones, touch tone phones allow you to continue to dial after the connection has been made, enabling the new telephone systems, such as automated menus. Additional buttons, they realized, could be handy in this regard. They settled on the asterisk (*) and the number, or pound sign (#), mostly because they were symbols that they knew computers would be able to recognize and were already on the standard QWERTY keyboard.</p>
								<p>Whatever it ought to be called, Chris Messina chose to use this symbol for collating Twitter searches in 2007 because he wanted a sign that could be input from a low-tech cell phone. He had two options: octothorpe or asterisk. He chose the former.</p>
								<p>And that is how the pound sign (or number sign, or hash mark, or octothorpe) came into ubiquity on billboards, promotional materials,  protest signs, and in your annoying friend's conversations.</p>

								<h3>Social</h3>
								
								<p>Like the am­persand, the ‘@' sym­bol is not strictly a mark of punc­tu­ation; rather, it is a logo­gram or gram­ma­logue, a short­hand for the word ‘at'. Even so, it is as much a staple of mod­ern com­mu­nic­a­tion as the semi­colon or ex­clam­a­tion mark, punc­tu­at­ing email ad­dresses and an­noun­cing Twit­ter user­names. Un­like the am­persand, though, whose jour­ney to the top took two mil­len­nia of steady per­sever­ance, the at sym­bol's cur­rent fame is quite ac­ci­dental. It can, in fact, be traced to the single stroke of a key made al­most ex­actly four dec­ades ago.</p>
								<p>Be­fore its as­cent to ac­ci­dental star­dom, the ‘@' went al­most un­re­marked for cen­tur­ies. Widely used to mean ‘at the rate of' the sym­bol lived out a use­ful but mundane ex­ist­ence in the world of com­merce, rarely war­rant­ing a second glance from pa­leo­graph­ers or philo­lo­gists. Even now, when it has been pro­pelled firmly into the lime­light by email's met­eoric rise, cred­ible ac­counts of the sym­bol's visual ap­pear­ance and mean­ing re­main sur­pris­ingly thin on the ground.</p>
								<p>Once ad­op­ted as part of the in­creas­ingly stand­ard­ised type­writer key­board, the ‘@' sym­bol's im­me­di­ate fu­ture was as­sured. As email (and the In­ter­net as a whole) grew more prom­in­ent, ‘@' came to sym­bol­ise not only the In­ter­net it­self but also a sort of gen­eric mod­ern­ity, or pro­gress.</p>
								<p>Now, though, some years after the dot-com bubble knocked the wind out of the first wave of in­ter­net en­tre­pren­eurs, the ‘@' has once again be­come com­mon­place, and an ever-ex­pand­ing roster of re­place­ments are tak­ing over its mantle. No longer is there a uni­ver­sal sym­bol of con­nec­ted­ness or mod­ern­ity, and this sur­vivor from the first days of the in­ter­net is giv­ing way to un­threat­en­ingly gen­eric ‘e-' and ‘i-' pre­fixes which owe more to mar­ket­ing de­part­ments than tech­nical in­nov­a­tion. The ‘@' has once again be­come com­mon cur­rency, al­though it can rightly claim a scope rather greater than pur­chase or­ders and gro­cers' chalk­boards.</p>

								<h3>Protest</h3>
								
								<p>In protest signs, posters, and editorial headlines, the exclamation point serves to communicate the emotions and intensity people have about society and politics.</p>
								<p>Turns out, no one really knows the history of the punctuation mark. The current running theory is that it comes from Latin. In Latin, the exclamation of joy was io, where the i was written above the o. And, since all their letters were written as capitals, an I with an o below it looks a lot like an exclamation point.</p>
								<p>But it wasn't until 1970 that the exclamation point had its own key on the keyboard. Before that, you had to type a period, and then use the backspace to go back and stick an apostrophe above it. When people dictated things to secretaries they would say "bang" to mark the exclamation point. Hence the interobang (?!) – a combination of a question (?) and an exclamation point (!). In the printing world, the exclamation point is called "a screamer, a gasper, a startler or a dog's cock."</p>

His work explores questions of race and identity and the stories we tell ourselves about living in America. Truth tellers and rabble-rousers in all areas of popular culture inspire his work—from Dave Chapelle and Kara Walker to Mos Def and Amos Kennedy, Jr. He learned a lot about design at Washington University in St. Louis, a lot about printing at Columbia College Chicago, and filled in the gaps with compassionate mentors and lots of practice.</p>
